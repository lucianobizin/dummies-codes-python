Thread

What is a thread? = imagine you are playing a car game, and you are driving...

		you are 1 thread
		the opponents are 1 thread
		the environment passing is a 1 thread


ALWAYS THERE IS A MAIN THREAD...AND IF YOU CREATE TWO THREADS, THERE WILL BE 3 THREADS.

from time import sleep
from threading import *

class Hello (Thread):

    def run (self):
        for i in range (5):
            print ("Hello")
            sleep(0.2)


class Hi (Thread):

    def run(self):
        for i in range(5):
            print("Hi")
            sleep(0.2)

he = Hello ()
hi = Hi ()

he.start ()
sleep(0.1)
hi.start ()

he.join()
hi.join()
print ("Bye")
